# Metasign
A lightweight ECDH and ECDSA application/library for generating key pairs and protecting data across multiple operating systems in a more portable format. Typical usage conditions such as the act of sharing a public key with an encrypted ECDH message have been resolved with minimal modifications to the overall base cryptosystem. All messages have the sender's public key automatically appended to the ciphertext, however, another public key may be provided in the event that one cannot be found within the message itself.

# Features
- Generation of ECDH key pairs as a string or a file
- Encryption & Decryption of data as a string or a file
- Custom logging with color support and optional output
- Dynamic garbage collection of cache files
- Dynamic loading of Python modules

___
> **Note**: The generation, signing, and verifying of data using ECDSA is currently unavailable and will be made so as soon as modifications have been completed.

# Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**  
`brew install python` or `sudo apt install python3-pip`
- **Cryptography**:  
`pip install cryptography` or `pip3 install cryptography` 

# Getting Started
### Generating a Key Pair
Currently keys are generated using a SECP384R1 curve and can be displayed as a string or written as files.

- **Generate and display keys**:  
`python3 ecdh.py`

Here is the private key generated above:
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIG2AgEAMBAGByqGSM49AgEGBSuBBAAiBIGeMIGbAgEBBDBOrccJLZxXmdpgGTG6
Z02rfuZD64xWhkC3AiJ5iNsTfwq5Y4qde7KDz9LJ+QWwp2qhZANiAARG+MJ9sHh0
W4Tb2mNdEjFAHZ2GM7A51bGjZDUKOt7MuI38DKzPHt7geQNSZY4Z6nfcXDnshsfK
E/p25pM6TggPyr0L9xI5LN/FjpdtJ8lLsEm4Z3J5jjt/jAHZLBH8myw=
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

- **Generate and write keys to a directory**:  
`python3 ecdh.py -o "./keys"`
> **Note**: Arguments do not require quotations but can be used for readability.

### Encrypting Data
Messages and files both can be encrypted as Metasign will automatically detect if the input is a file path or string. The encrypted data will also contain the public key associated with the private key used to actually perform the encryption, so pre-sharing, or post-sharing, of said public key is not necessary. You can just share the data!
> **Note**: Keys can be used directly in the terminal as a string rather than reading them from a file .  

> **Important**: *All* encryption functions require a private and public key to be imported, e.g. `-i or --import` and `-k or --key`, in order to work properly.

- **Encrypting a string message**:  
We'll load a private and public key assuming the key pair exists within a directory called `keys` or similar:
<br/>`python3 ecdh.py -i "./keys/private.pem" -e "Hello, World!" -k "./keys/public.pem"`

Here is the encrypted data generated above:
```

```

- **Encrypting a file**:  
Import a private and public key assuming the key pair exists within a directory called `keys` and also assuming a file called `data.txt` exists. When a file is encrypted an output directory is created called `output` in order to organize and more easily identify the location of cipherdata and plaintext messages:
<br/>`python3 ecdh.py -i "./keys/private.pem" -e "./data.txt" -k "./keys/public.pem"`

### Decrypting Data
Messages and files both can be decrypted as Metasign will automatically detect if the input is a file path or string. All that is required to decrypt a message or file is the private key associated with the public key that originally encrypted the data and the data itself. A public key from the sender can also be imported using `-k or --key`.

- **Decrypting a string message**:  
We'll import a private and public key assuming the key pair exists within a directory called `keys` or similar:
<br/>`python3 ecdh.py -i "./keys/private.pem" -d "<ciphertext>"`  
> **Note**: Ciphertext is the encrypted data like the generated data above in the `Encrypting Data` section .

- **Decrypting a file**:  
We'll import a private and public key assuming the key pair exists within a directory called `keys` and also assuming a file called `data.txt.enc` exists:
<br/>`python3 ecdh.py -i "./keys/private.pem" -d "./output/data.txt.enc"`

### Help & Usage
Below is an image containing all of the help and usage information currently available for Metasign and the entire ECDH/ECDSA suite. There are multiple future plans for more features, options, and other updates related to the project as well. With advances in technology and the algorithms used there is also a push to become quantum resistant by implementing things such as Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman and other lattice based systems.
